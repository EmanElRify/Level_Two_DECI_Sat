# Session 17: Intro to circuits

Welcome to Session 17! ðŸš€ <mark> Here, we start talking about electronic circuits! Hold on! What does "electronic" mean? ðŸ¤“ <br>
Electronic simply means having to do with electrons.
A circuit is simply a path that allows electrons to flow through it.
> The atoms which make up all things consist of a number of particles including the electron, the proton and the neutron. 
> Atoms are normally electrically neutral because they have the same number of electrons as they have protons. 
- If some electrons are removed from the atoms of a body, that body becomes positively charged because it will have lost some negative electricity. 
- Conversely, a body which gains electrons becomes negatively charged (if you comb your hair the comb will gain some electrons and your hair will lose some). 
- Positively charged bodies attract negatively charged bodies and repel other positively charged bodies (which is why the comb can make your hair stand on end!).
